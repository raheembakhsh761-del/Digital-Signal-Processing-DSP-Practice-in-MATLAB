🎯 Objective

The goal of this repository is to provide hands-on practice with core DSP principles using MATLAB.
It helps in understanding how signals are processed, analyzed, and transformed in both time and frequency domains.

🧩 Concepts Covered

The repository includes MATLAB programs and scripts related to:

Signal generation and analysis

Sampling and reconstruction

Aliasing and anti-aliasing

Filtering (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass)

Convolution and correlation

Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

Upsampling and downsampling

Interpolation and decimation

Frequency response analysis

Spectral analysis and visualization

Multirate signal processing

⚙️ Tools Used

MATLAB (Online or Desktop)

Signal Processing Toolbox
